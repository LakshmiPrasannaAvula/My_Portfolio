## Personal Portfolio

A clean, modern, fully responsive personal portfolio website built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
Designed for students or fresher developers to showcase their profile, education, internship experience, projects, skills, resume, and contact links.

### Features

- **Hero / Intro**: Profile area with name, short introduction, and quick access links.
- **Education**: Timeline-style education section.
- **Internship Experience**: Card-based layout for roles and responsibilities.
- **Projects**: Project cards with GitHub and live demo links.
- **Skills & Resume**: Skills grouped by category and a resume download button.
- **Contact**: Email, LinkedIn, and GitHub links in a clean grid.
- **Smooth scrolling** and **simple scroll animations** for sections.
- **Responsive layout** that works well on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

### Structure

- `index.html` – Main HTML page with all sections.
- `style.css` – Styling, layout, responsiveness, and animations.
- `script.js` – Smooth scrolling, mobile navigation, scroll‑in animations, and footer year.
- `assets/resume.pdf` – (Optional) Place your resume file here and ensure the file name matches.

### How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double‑click or open with your preferred browser).
2. Edit the placeholder content in:
   - Name, intro, and initials in the hero section.
   - Education, experience, and skills text.
   - Project titles, descriptions, GitHub URLs, and live demo URLs.
   - Contact email, LinkedIn, and GitHub profile links.
3. Add your own profile picture (you can replace the initials block in the hero area if you prefer).
4. Place your resume file in an `assets` folder and update the link if the file name is different.

### Customization Tips

- You can tweak brand colors in `style.css` under the `:root` variables.
- Fonts are loaded from Google Fonts (`Poppins`); feel free to change to another family if you prefer.
- Animations can be turned off globally by using the OS-level “reduced motion” setting, which the site respects.
